Show Notes
----------
* If your game is a passion project, where just adding anything is the fun, prioritization will be different
* Most important in deadline driven projects that need to finish to ship
* Prioritization could be for specific milestones, events, opportunities
* Important goal for prioritization: “purchasable”
* Prioritize integration (steam) over optional or extra content
* Marketing events could be prioritized as part of the deadline pressure, prioritization touches all areas
* Linear progress of game may not map to actual priorities
* Jaycie says "Build levels 1, 5, then 3"
* Calvin says "Build levels 3, 0, then -1"
* Some times, you can prioritize for your own motivation and reward feedback
* Jaycie mentions the `“I Should Be Writing” podcast <http://murverse.com/subscribe-to-podcasts/isbw/>`_
* Figuring out an ending helped to move Jaycie’s project forward
* Don’t let asset quality hold you back
* Remember, Kirby was originally a placeholder!
