Welcome to Side Quest Completed, the gamedev hobby podcast!

In this episode Calvin and Jaycie recount a dozen games between the two of them which they've never
finished, their feelings on not finishing games, and intents to revisist past projects or to set
them aside forever to focus on better things.

*NOTE*: We had some recording issues at the start of this episode. Apologies for the low quality
on Calvin's end. The issue is resolved a few minutes in, so please hang in there!
